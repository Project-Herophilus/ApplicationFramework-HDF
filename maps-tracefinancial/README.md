# Mapping Trace Financial
This submodule is dedicated to using Trace Financials map builder and runtime engine tooling. 

Like all assets within Project-Herophilus, this project is available and provided "as-is" under
the [Apache 2 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) model. Because this is built
using external vendor technologies it is expected that you work with the vendor to ensure you comply with their licensing requirements.

# Focus on Improving
We are focusing on continuing to improve. With the numerous implementation and partner implementations we
have focused on success overall and as we progress forward the intent is to focus on success while being consistent.
Please find details on how to help us [here](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/blob/main/OngoingEnhancements.md).

# General Pre-Requisites
For any repository to be implemented there are two types of requirements, overall general requirements
and then there are specific submodule requirements. We try and maintain as close to a current detailed list
as we can, for those specifics please check [here](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/blob/main/PreRequisites.md).

# Specific Technology Pre-Requisities
In order to use these maps you will need to get a license file to use from
info@tracefinancial.com. The license file includes the ability to run the design time 
mapping tool and also the runtime engine. 

# Sample Projects
Below are some sample projects.

# Implementating this Module
The following section is designed to cover the details around implementing.

## Implementation Guides to Help
This specific module is being developed with the vendor currently. However, For the specifics around one or more 
iDaaS implementations for this module please feel free to look
[here](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/blob/main/Platform-Content/ImplementationGuides/intro.md).

## How To Get, Build and Run Assets
Within each submodule/design pattern/reference architecture in this repository there is a specific README.md. It is
intended to follow a specific format that covers a solution definition, how we look to continually improve, pre-requisities,
implementation details including specialized configuration, known issues and their potential resolutions.
However, there are a lot of individual capabilities, we have tried to keep content relevant and specific to
cover specific topics.
- For cloning, building and running of assets that content can be found
  [here](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/blob/main/CloningBuildingRunningSolution.md).
- Within each implementation there is a management console, the management console provides the same
  interface and capabilities no matter what implementation you are working within, some specifics and
  details can be found [here](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/blob/main/AdministeringPlatform.md).
