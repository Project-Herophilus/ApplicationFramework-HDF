# iDAAS-Route-PublicCloud
iDAAS-Route-PublicCloud specifically is ONLY intended to deal with enabling
iDAAS to all sorts of specific routing to public cloud vendors and their published and connectedable components. These components are determined 
by what Apache Camel and its community support. These components can be found at https://camel.apache.org/components/3.12.x/index.html.

## Pre-Requisites
For all iDaaS design patterns it should be assumed that you will either install as part of this effort, or have the following:
1. An existing Kafka (or some flavor of it) up and running. Red Hat currently implements AMQ-Streams based on Apache Kafka; however, we
have implemented iDaaS with numerous Kafka implementations. Please see the following files we have included to try and help: <br/>
[Kafka](https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/iDaaS-Demos/blob/master/Kafka.md)<br/>
[KafkaWindows](https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/iDaaS-Demos/blob/master/KafkaWindows.md)<br/>
No matter the platform chosen it is important to know that the Kafka out of the box implementation might require some changes depending
upon your implementation needs. Here are a few we have made to ensure: <br/>
In <kafka>/config/consumer.properties file we will be enhancing the property of auto.offset.reset to earliest. This is intended to enable any new
system entering the group to read ALL the messages from the start. <br/>
auto.offset.reset=earliest <br/>
2. Some understanding of building, deploying Java artifacts and the commands associated. If using Maven commands then Maven would need to be intalled and runing for the environment you are using. More details about Maven can be found [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)<br/>
3. An internet connection with active internet connectivity, this is to ensure that if any Maven commands are
run and any libraries need to be pulled down they can.<br/>
